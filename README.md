RNG Guessing Game with Python

I know there are a lot of projects out there for rng guessing game, but this one is special to me, even if it might make seasoned coders cringe... I've put myself in a situation to force myself to do trial and error. There were a lot of debugging moments and figuring out what is okay and what is not okay syntax. BUT When I got the first good run (the 'yes' vs 'no' boolean answer path), you would've thought I was watching sports and seeing my favorite team score a goal. Fists in the air, yelling "F-YEA!! AHH! I DID IT!", My heart was racing! 

I hope to continue to grow and to have more happy moments. As should you! 

Thank you for reading this. :)
